# CaseStudy
A schedueling system for a photographer's buisness

The idea?
Photographic website.

Itâ€™s main purpose is to showcase the photographers skills.
The portfolio section will show past work hopefully this will lead to booking clients. 
Potential clients are able to browse trough. For example they can see the home page porfolito, about me and see available openings. 
However to book a session they have the option of either registering or become a guest. 
Booking a date will have an email sent out to verify with an book id.
If registered, they will user their email to login. If the client is a guest then they will need their email and their book id number.

There should also be an admin session that will have access to see all upcoming booked sessions and their payment status. 
Also they can gray out dates of their choosing from the schedule .

Type of application
Professional website than can book events
Key functions
Ability to create a username with contact info and billing info.

User/Gues can book/cancel a date for a photo session.
Have one  admin with the potential of expading to more admins, who will have access to all booked sessions and paymet status.

Also, there would be a contact info to reach out for any questions and links to follow photographer on social media.
